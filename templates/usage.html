<h1>Usage of this Site</h1>
<p>This site can be used in a number of different ways.</p>
<h2>URIs</h2>
<p>This is this site's <em>raison d'Ãªtre</em>&mdash;to give easy access to 
    timestamp translations directly from a browser's address bar.</p>
<h3>Timestamp URIs</h3>
<p>The easiest way to get information on a particular timestamp is to enter 
    it directly into your browser's address bar, like so:</p>
<pre><a href="/123456789" title="Link to example Unix Timestamp">http://unixtimesta.mp/123456789</a></pre>
<p>This will bring up information on the timestamp 123456789.</p>
<h3>Date and Time URIs</h3>
<p>If you want to go in the opposite direction and get a timestamp for a 
    particular date and time, you can do this by building a URL with the year, 
    month and date, followed by optional hour, minute and second values.</p>
<p>For example, to get the timestamp for the 31st March, 1978, use the 
    following URI:</p>
<pre><a href="/1978/3/31" title="Example link to a Unix Timestamp for a specific date and time">http://unixtimesta.mp/1978/3/31</a></pre>
<p>For 3:45:22 PM on that day, just add the hour (in 24-hour time), the 
    minute and the number of seconds to the URI:</p>
<pre><a href="/1978/3/31/15/45/22" title="Example link to a Unix Timestamp for a specific date and time">http://unixtimesta.mp/1978/3/31/15/45/22</a></pre>
<h3>Descriptive URIs</h3>
<p>You can also request a description of any date and time, and using the 
    magic of 
    <a href="http://labix.org/python-dateutil">python-dateutil</a>
    function, the site will do it's best to try and figure what you're on 
    about.</p>
<pre><a href="/Wednesday" title="Example link to a Unix Timestamp for a description of a date and time" style="text-decoration: none;">http://unixtimesta.mp/Wednesday</a></pre>
